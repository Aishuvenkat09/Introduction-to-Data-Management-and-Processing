DBLP database of bibliographic information on major computer science
journals and proceedings, available from https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/3p9w84t5mr. The dataset has
been processed to include predictions of the author’s genders using the open-source Genderize API. The
processed data has been made available in the form of SQL scripts that import the data into a MySQL
database. We are primarily interested in the “general” and “authors” tables created by the “main.sql” and
“authors.sql” scripts, respectively
