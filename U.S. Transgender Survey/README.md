via the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR), of which Northeastern
University is a member, at http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/studies/31721 or via a proxy link

We would like to investigate how certain questions break down among trans women, trans men, and non-binary
