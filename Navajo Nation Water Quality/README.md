Water quality is a major issue on American Indian reservations in the southwestern United States. The
prevalence of uranium mines and uranium mill accidents mean that much of the water in the Navajo Nation
is irradiated, and many homes are left without clean, drinkable water. Multiple environmental agencies
routinely sample water in the region and report on contaminants


The concentration of radiactive elements in a sample is measured in rate of atomic disintegrations per volume,
rather than mass per volume, as used for stable isotopes. This is done by counting the number of atomic
disintegrations per minute and comparing it to the mass of the material involved. However, laboratory
environments and instruments used for detection create some number of atomic emissions on their own, so
background correction must be performed. Because this process involves sampling many times, and the
background can be inconsistent, resulting in over-correction, sometimes negative values are reported for the
concentration. For practical purposes, these values can be considered zero.
